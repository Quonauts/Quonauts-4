## #41

Add the text between [start] and [end] as a new rule titled “Sectors” at the end of the rules list:

[start] A "sector" is any unique integer combination of X and Y, written as "sector <x>, <y>”. The set of all sectors is "space."[end]

Add the text between [start] and [end] as a new rule titled “Warp Drive” at the end of the rules list:
[start]A player may at any time spend n points to receive a Warp Core (where n is the day of the month/3 rounded up). A Warp Core is a quantity which may be spent to traverse space. At any time, a player may spend one Warp Core, which allows them to modify their sector position as they desire up to four spaces (the amount of spaces being x + y, and effectively changing their X and Y quantities). Also, upon using a warp core, a player may spend 1 point to move 8 spaces instead.[end]

Append the following paragraph to the bottom of "Proposal content":

`[start]`
If multiple proposals describe the modification or addition of sections,
paragraphs, or sentences to the same part of the rules, conflicts should be
resolved based on the age of the proposal, such that the newer proposal's effect
overrides the older one's. For example, if proposal #10 adds a new section "A"
to the bottom of the rules, and proposal #11 adds a new section "B" to the
bottom of the rules, and both proposals pass, then regardless of which proposal
passed first, section "B" will appear below section "A" in the rules.
`[end]`

<a name='46'/>

content of proposal B, however, does not change.
`[end]`

<a name='48'/>

## #48

[end]

<a name='49'/>

## #49

Append the following paragraph to the bottom of "Closing proposals":

`[start]`

`[end]`

<a name='50'/>

## #50

## #51

<a name='52'/>

## #52

Create a new rule titled “Fleets” directly after the rule “Warp Drive” which consists of the following text which is between `[start]` and `[end]`:
`[start]`Players within 1 sector of each other (x and y, so a maximum of 1 in each of x and y apart) can mutually elect to form a fleet at any time. Fleets move together, whenever one player uses a warp drive or changes his position in any way, the other players in the fleet move relative to the moving player. A player can at any time leave a fleet but this does not undo movements cuased by the fleet previously. If a player is next to another player that is in a fleet, the player may join the fleet, whether he is within 1 space of all players in the fleet or only one. If all the players connecting a single player to the rest of the fleet disband, the player is forced to disband as of that moment. Players may refer to different fleets as anything they choose, but individual players may only be in a single fleet at a time.`[end]`

Additionally, amend any existing uses of gendered "he/him/his" or "she/her/hers" in proposals and rules to "they/them/their."

<a name='54'/>

## #54

`[end]`
