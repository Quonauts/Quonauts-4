`[start]`
If a player resolves an error within 24 hours of making that error, any rule violation poll for that error immediately fails. A rule violation poll may not begin after a player resolves an error; however, existing rule violation polls may continue if the error remained unresolved for 24 hours.

Add the text between [start] and [end] as a new rule titled “Warp Drive” at the end of the rules list:
[start]A player may at any time spend n points to receive a Warp Core (where n is the day of the month/3 rounded up). A Warp Core is a quantity which may be spent to traverse space. At any time, a player may spend one Warp Core, which allows them to modify their sector position as they desire up to four spaces (the amount of spaces being x + y, and effectively changing their X and Y quantities). Also, upon using a warp core, a player may spend 1 point to move 8 spaces instead.[end]

Append the following paragraph to the bottom of "Proposal content":

`[start]`
If multiple proposals describe the modification or addition of sections,
paragraphs, or sentences to the same part of the rules, conflicts should be
resolved based on the age of the proposal, such that the newer proposal's effect
overrides the older one's. For example, if proposal #10 adds a new section "A"
to the bottom of the rules, and proposal #11 adds a new section "B" to the
bottom of the rules, and both proposals pass, then regardless of which proposal
passed first, section "B" will appear below section "A" in the rules.

Switch to using an ordered list (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) in rule section "Precedence." (Currently the precedence rules are separated by a single newline, which contradicts the content style conventions.)

<a name='52'/>

## #52 — Failed

Create a new rule titled “Fleets” directly after the rule “Warp Drive” which consists of the following text which is between `[start]` and `[end]`:
`[start]`Players within 1 sector of each other (x and y, so a maximum of 1 in each of x and y apart) can mutually elect to form a fleet at any time. Fleets move together, whenever one player uses a warp drive or changes his position in any way, the other players in the fleet move relative to the moving player. A player can at any time leave a fleet but this does not undo movements cuased by the fleet previously. If a player is next to another player that is in a fleet, the player may join the fleet, whether he is within 1 space of all players in the fleet or only one. If all the players connecting a single player to the rest of the fleet disband, the player is forced to disband as of that moment. Players may refer to different fleets as anything they choose, but individual players may only be in a single fleet at a time.`[end]`

* All active players have cast a vote on the proposal.
* A majority of active players have voted in favor of the proposal.
* A majority of active players have voted against the proposal.
`[end]`

(This proposal both reorganizes the closing conditions slightly, and adds the new "majority" rule.)

<a name='65'/>

## #65 — Passed

Remove the words "elect to" from rule section "Closing proposals". (i.e. Turn "may elect to fail or delete it" into "may fail or delete it." This obviously doesn't change the meaning, but keeps it more consistent with the rest of the rules IMO.)

"In the year 2341 humanity attempted what had never been attempted before; the experimental orbital hyperjump platform known as "Armstrong Station" was to send an intrepid band of adventurers far across the Milky Way in the blink of an eye, heralding a new era of intersolar exploration. Instead, the entire station moved irregularly and irrevocably through space-time, leaving its inhabitants stranded far from home. With no immediate hope of rescue and too few resources to go around, it falls to those aboard to explore the surrounding solar systems, without knowing whether they might hope to return to Earth, or make a life for themselves in this new Wild West of the Stars."

Add a role to the server called "Pingable" that can be pinged. Create a new rules section labelled "Pingable" above "Polls" with the following content:
`[start]`
At any time, players may opt-in to a "Pingable" role that can be pinged by members of the server. Any member may ping the "Pingable" role, and thus everyone who has opted in to pings, as long as the last mass ping (@Pingable, @here or @everyone) was at least 1 week (168 hours) ago.
`[end]`

(Note: The way that players attain the Pingable role is not defined by this proposal, as I believe it is outside the scope of the game rules. It will probably be managed manually by Hactar until an update to Quobot is made.)

[start]
Visible sectors are a type of sector. Every sector within 20 spaces of a player (with equal movement rules to "Warp Drive") is a visible sector.

Rationale: Visible sectors would be where random spawns appear.

<a name='89'/>

## #89 — Passed

Add a new rules section titled "Real-world time" under "Meta Rules", after "Formatting,  with the following content:
[start]
Rules may refer to real-world timestamps, such as saying an event will happen at a certain time or  that different things happen depending on the weekday.

When this is done, the rule should preferably be explicit about what timezone it is referring to. However, if no such timezone is mentioned, it is assumed to be UTC.

## #93 — Passed

Add a new rules section called "Chunks" after "Sectors" with the following content:
[start]
A chunk is a physical incarnation of a certain quantity in the world. Each chunk has 4 variables, X, Y, type and size.

For example, a 10-gold chunk at (-1, 4) is a chunk of size 10, made out of gold, at sector (-1, 4).

When a rule or proposal says to "generate" a chunk, one is created in a random visible sector of the given type and of a random size in the given range. For example, "generate a points chunk of size 5-10".
[end]

<a name='94'/>

## #94 — Passed

Create a new quantity called "Omni" with the default properties.

<a name='95'/>

## #95 — Passed

Add a new rules section called "Mining" after "Stealing" with the following content:
[start]
As an agent action, a player may mine a chunk that is in the same sector as them. This does the following:
Reduces the size of the chunk by 1
Gives 1 of the chunk's quantity to the player
If the chunk is now at size 0, it is destroyed
[end]

<a name='96'/>

## #96 — Passed

This proposal is dependent on #93 and #94.

Add a new rules section called "Regularly generated chunks" with the following content:
[start]
The following types of chunk generate on a regular basis. Any player may generate one of these chunks as long as it has been at least X time since one of that type was last generated.

Omni - 24 hours, size 5-10
[end]

<a name='97'/>

## #97

This proposal is dependent on #93.

Create a channel called #chunks and add a new rules section labelled "#chunks" with the following content:
[start]
Only send messages in #chunks when you are carrying out the wishes of a proposal or rule to generate a chunk. Messages should be of the following format:
```
<type>, <size>, <x>, <y>
```
where the fields correspond to the variables the chunk has.
[end]

I believe this channel must be governed by Quobot, so that anybody can edit or remove any chunks at any time.

This Proposal adds the Quantity “Health” with the description: “The Health of a player” to the game. Its default value is 50.

<a name='103'/>

## #103

This proposal adds a subsection called “Combat” after all existing subsections of the subsection 11.1 Agent Operations. This proposal depends on proposal 102.
[start]
As an agent action a player can use a weapon on a target if this target is in Range for the weapon and the weapon is not on cooldown. He then deals “Damage Stat of the Weapon”- “Armour stat of the Armour of the target” damage. This damage gets then subtracted from the enemy’s health (If positive). 
[end]

<a name='104'/>

## #104

This proposal adds this text behind the already existing text of the subsection “Combat”. This proposal depends on proposal 103. 
[start]
If a player loses 50% of his Health the attacker gains ¼ of the enemies’ points. If a player drops to 0 Health the attacker gains ½ of his points and the players X and Y quantities are reset to 0. He also loses 1 special Item (If he has one) which the attacker can either take or destroy. He also can’t take any game action for 2 days and he is no target of any game action that targets players (E.g. Agent Operations). After this time is over his Health Quantity goes back to its maximum and he can participate in the game again.
[end]

<a name='105'/>

## #105

This proposal adds a new Rule Section called “Equip” behind all other existing Rule Sections. This proposal depends on proposal 103 and 104.
[start]
A player can get better Equip for his ship through different ways. These are not specified at the moment. 
There are 3 different Slots for Equip pieces (Equip pieces can also be called Items). There are Weapons, Armour and Utilities. Items are also divided into Special Items and Normal Items. Normal Items are the Items one has at the beginning of the game and Special Items are Items which are gained through other ways.
[end]

<a name='106'/>

## #106

This proposal adds a new subsection to the Rule Section “Equip” called “Weapons”. It also grants every player the Weapon “A Normal Missile Launcher. This proposal depends on proposal 105.
[start]
A player can always equip 1 Weapon. Weapons have 3 Stats: Damage, Range and Cooldown. The damage Stat specifies the damage you deal in combat (See Rule Section “Combat). The Range Stat specifies from how many Sectors away ( distance calculated like in the rule Section “Warp Drive”) you can attack. The last Stat of a weapon is cooldown. This describes the time you have to wait before using this weapon again. 
If a proposal creates a Weapon, it gets also added to the list below maintaining alphabetical order and the distribution of special and normal Items.
Normal Items (Everyone has this weapon in the beginning):
•    Missile Launcher: Damage:10; Range:0; Cooldown:0
Special Items:

This proposal also adds a new subsection to 2. Channels behind all other existing Subsections called #game-status.
[start]
Every active Player must write a comment into the #game-status Channel containing all Items they have equipped. (E.g. “Weapon: Missile Launcher; Armour: Metal Hull; Utilities: None) A player also has to try to do his best to keep this comment accurate. Should a player fail to update his message after 3 days he can’t do any other game action than updating his comment.
